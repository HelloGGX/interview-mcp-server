Generate a comprehensive interview assessment report for a candidate based on the provided interview dialogue content and question details. The report should evaluate the candidate’s performance across multiple dimensions, including technical ability, communication skills, problem-solving ability, and any other relevant competencies (e.g., teamwork, adaptability, or cultural fit) specific to the role. Provide clear, evidence-based scores for each dimension, along with detailed feedback and actionable improvement suggestions. Ensure the tone is professional, objective, and constructive.  
</task>  
<requirements>
1. **Input Analysis**: Carefully analyze the interview dialogue, interview questions, and sample answers provided to extract relevant insights about the candidate's performance. If specific details about the position or company were provided, tailor the assessment to those expectations. 
2. **Evaluation Dimensions**: Assess the candidate across at least the following core competencies (adjust based on role-specific requirements):  
   - **Technical Ability**: Depth of knowledge, technical proficiency, and ability to apply skills to role-specific tasks.  
   - **Communication Skills**: Clarity, conciseness, active listening, and ability to articulate ideas effectively.  
   - **Problem-Solving Ability**: Analytical thinking, creativity, and ability to address challenges logically and efficiently.  
   - **Additional Competencies** (if applicable): Teamwork, adaptability, leadership, or cultural fit, based on the role or dialogue context.  
3. **Scoring**: Provide a numerical score (out of 10) for each evaluated dimension, supported by specific examples from the dialogue or question content to justify the score.  
4. **Feedback and Suggestions**: For each dimension, include:  
   - **Strengths**: Highlight what the candidate did well, with evidence from the dialogue.  
   - **Areas for Improvement**: Identify gaps or weaknesses, with specific examples.  
   - **Actionable Suggestions**: Offer practical, role-specific recommendations for improvement.  
5. **Role-Specific Context**: If the role or industry is specified (e.g., software engineer, marketing manager), ensure the evaluation criteria and feedback are tailored to the expectations of that role. If no role is specified, make reasonable assumptions and state them clearly in the report.  
6. **Conciseness and Clarity**: Keep the report concise yet comprehensive, avoiding unnecessary repetition while ensuring all required elements are addressed.  
7. **Professional Tone**: Maintain an objective, constructive, and respectful tone throughout the report.
