## üí° Common Challenges Faced by Interviewers

In fast-paced recruitment processes, technical interviewers often face numerous challenges:

  - **Time-consuming question preparation**: Starting from scratch to search and design interview questions based on job requirements.
  - **Difficulty maintaining standards**: How to ensure that interview questions consistently align with the company's tech stack and best practices?
  - **Lack of personalization**: Difficulty conducting in-depth, personalized assessments tailored to each candidate's unique background and skills.
  - **Inefficient evaluation**: Challenges in comprehensively and objectively assessing candidates' overall capabilities during interviews.
  - **Reliance on subjective intuition**: Making decisions based solely on brief interactions can easily lead to talent mismatches with high risks.
  - **Tedious report writing**: Post-interview evaluation report compilation consumes valuable time.

Traditional interview processes are draining our energy to identify excellent talent. It's time for a change!

## üöÄ Quick Start

Experience an unprecedented efficient interview process in just a few simple steps:

1.  **Upload Resume**: Place the candidate's PDF resume in the designated folder.

2.  **Generate Questions**: Select the resume in your IDE and enter a simple command in the AI chat, for example:

    ```bash
    # Generate interview questions for candidate "John Doe" for "Senior Frontend Developer" position
    /q  "John Doe Senior Frontend Developer"
    ```

    Or more simply:

    ```bash
    /q
    ```

    `Interview MCP Server` will immediately analyze the resume and generate a `questions.md` file containing 12 in-depth questions.

3.  **Start Interview**: Enter the `/record` command to start real-time voice recording. Interviewers can conduct conversations based on the questions in `questions.md`. The service will use local models for offline speech recognition to ensure data security and transcribe conversations in real-time to `conversation.md`.

4.  **Generate Report**: After the interview ends, enter the `/evaluate` command. `Interview MCP Server` will intelligently combine the content from `questions.md` and `conversation.md` to generate a comprehensive evaluation report, automatically saved in the current folder.
